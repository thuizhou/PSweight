Description:Supports propensity score weighting analysis of observational studies and randomized trials. Enables the estimation and inference of average causal effects among target populations with binary and multiple treatments using the methods developed in Li, Morgan and Zaslavsky (2018) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1260466> and Li and Li (2019) <doi:10.1214/19-AOAS1282>.
